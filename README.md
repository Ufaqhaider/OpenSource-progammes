Resources for CODXCRYPT session

## Getting started‚ö°
### How to find issues‚Åâ:-
- Learn some coding languages/frameworks. But in case you dont know, its still okay. you Can contribute and <code>learn on the go</code>
- find goood first issues <a href="https://goodfirstissues.com/">here</a>

                          OR
- You can also find Good first issues by Github Search.

> paste this in the search
   <code>is:open is:issue no:assignee label:"good first issue" archived:false </code>
   
you can add additional parameter of <code>language:<LANGUAGE_YOU_KNOW></code>
example:    <code>is:open is:issue no:assignee label:"good first issue" archived:false <b>language:html</b> </code>

### How to get issues assignedüîó 
In most organisations, you are welcome to find an issue and send PR directly, but that is not a good practice. I prefer simple workflow <b>comment> commit> create PR</b>

 <b>COMMENT</b>:- comment on the issue of your interest and ask to be assigned for the issue. Issues are generally assigned on first-come-first-serve basis.
 
 <b>COMMIT</b>:- fork the repo, make changes, and <b>commit changes to new branch</b>. But why a new branch? the reason is simple. Suppose you are working on multiple issues, it gives flexibility. 
 
 <b>CREATE PR</b>:- now, set your branch to the new branch that have the changes codes. Click on contribute, compare and send a PR.
 
‚ö† A NOTE FOR PR. 

kindly send a well documented PR and attach media whenever needed. If your PR solves an already exixting issue, in your PR description, mention that issue by writing #{issue_id}.Issue id can be found in issue itself

#### wait for the repo owners to review your PR, and if it does the job, it will be merged!üéâ

## Opensource events
1) Google Summer Of Code a.k.a GSOC
  <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSOC</a> is annual opensourc eevent of google where students get chance to work with variouus organisations on guided projects. Aim of GSOC is to promote open-source culture. GSOC is dream of every open-source enthuciast and around 1300+ students are selected globally for a period of around 3 months.
on successful completion of projects, students receive handsome stipend. Its a great opportunity to work on real world projects and impact millions of users
  
2) Outreachy 
  <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> is very similar to GSoC, with the main difference that is aimed at minorities, so it is mainly directed towards women and people whose minority is underrepresented in technology. The other difference is that it is held twice a year, while GSoC is only held once. Outreachy has less pool of money and selects less number of students as compared to GSOC, but the individual stipend is more than GSOC.
  
3) MLH fellowhip
  The <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">MLH Fellowship</a> is an internship alternative for software engineers, with a focus on Open Source projects. Instead of working on a project for just one company, students contribute to Open Source projects that are used by companies around the world.
  it have 3 tracks:-
  - <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source">Opensource track</a>
  - <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/software-engineering">Software engineering</a>
  - <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/production-engineering">Production engineer</a>
